// Week 7 - Lab. 
// This week we'll apply our knowledge of loops in our code and make sure that we understand how to use these to repeat an action. 

// Task 1- fill in the background colours. 

// Task 2 - Use our rect command to add more rectangles at 100 pixel intervals to fill in all of the grass area. 

// Task 3 - Now replace this code with a for loop. 

// Task 4 - Add a house at 25 pixels across, 350 pixels down. Fill it in dark brown. 

//Task 5 - Use another for loop to create a row of houses. 

// Task 6 - Use one final for loop to create a row of the roof on the houses. 

 
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
  noStroke();
  
  
}

function draw() {
  // Task 1 - Fill in the sky blue. 
  background(220);
  
  // Task 1 - Draw the sun- orange
  noStroke();
  ellipse(335, 66, 70, 70);
  

  // Task 1 - Draw the grass lawn green 
  rect(0,400,100,100);
  
 
  // Task 2 - Add more rectangles to complete the grass. 
  
  
  // Task 3 - Replace our code we just wrote with a for loop. 
  
  // Task 4 & 5 - Add another for loop for our houses. 
  
  // Task 6 - Add rooves to each of our houses.
